# List of Cool Links

## What and Why

Google and Bing have become very crappy. Every day I find it harder and
harder to find stuff there. Some time ago I wrote a tweet stating that
__'I used to be a Google user, now it doesn't find anything. I moved to
Bing a month ago, it's now become the same. It's all AI nonsense. It's
time to go back to 'Cool Sites' links on personal webpages. We've gone
full circle.'__

This is my (self) response to that.

(BTW I use Ecosia now, and it seems to work much better than the alternatives.
It's a keyword based search engine (citation needed) , so it doesn't search by
matching your query to website profiles; it actually tries to match the words
you requested.)

I've recently learned about Awesome Lists*. I don't think this qualifies as one.
But here's some stuff I found interesting. I'm mostly into game design and
development (particularly MMORPGs), so I expect to end up adding a lot of
resources about that here. And other things. I hope you find it interesing too!

_**Awesome Lists are curated lists of resources about a specific topic. These
lists are often created and maintained by enthusiasts and experts in the respective
field.*_
