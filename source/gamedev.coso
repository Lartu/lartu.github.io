{{ title Videogames }}

I've long held a passion for game development. Back in the day I released many
Flash games and, with the advent of Android and iOS devices, I've also made my
way into the Play Store and the App Store. Lately, I've been also working on
browser-based and downloadable games for PC.

/* I have as well written some short, nonsensical JavaScript excerpts that do
useless stuff that I like to call toys. Both things are listed on this page. */

I've always wanted to make an MMORPG and this is it. It's not a hardcore
MMORPG by any means, it's more casual than anything, but people keep logging
in and playing and they seem to really like it. The game is frequently
updated with new content.

{{ subtitle Soft Drizzle: B-Track (MacOS & Windows, 2020) }}

{{ midimg sdb.png }}

{{Soft Drizzle: B-Track => https://lartu.itch.io/soft-drizzle-b-track }} is a
short (30 - 50 min. long) visual novel about friendship and Halloween
Festivals. It even includes an escape room! It was written in Unity over the
course of a month as my submission for the 
{{Spooktober Visual Novel Jam => https://itch.io/jam/spooktober-visual-novel-jam-by-devtalk2}}.
It's a
sequel to Soft Drizzle, a visual novel I released a month earlier. Graphics are
bigger and better and it even includes 3D scenes to interact with and explore.

{{ subtitle Soft Drizzle (Browser-based, 2020) }}

{{ midimg sd.png }}

{{ Soft Drizzle => https://lartu.itch.io/soft-drizzle}} is a short (15 - 25 min. long) visual novel about
friendship and rainy days. It was written in JavaScript and {{ p5.js => https://p5js.org }}
over the course of seven days as my submission 
{{ 2020's LOWREZJAM => https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam-2020}}. As such, it's resultion is 64x64, so I'd
hardly believe you've played a smaller visual novel before!
People really, really liked it and I'm very happy with the cute, wholesome result.

{{ subtitle Fateful Lore (Android & iOS, 2020) }}

{{ midimg fl.png }}

{{Fateful Lore => https://fantaseel.itch.io/fateful-lore}}
is an all-new retro-style role-playing game by 
{{Fantaseel Interactive => https://fantaseel.com/}}, 
a start-up I set up with some colleages to develop video-games.
Inspired by old-school, 8-bit JRPGs, Fateful Lore is a nostalgic adventure
that will delight fans of the genre! It's inspired by classic RPGs like Dragon
Quest and Final Fantasy. We found that there were no RPGs on these platforms
that looked and played like the games we loved when we were young, so we
decided to make one ourselves.

{{ subtitle Eternal Lux (Android, 2014) }}

{{ midimg el.png }}

{{Eternal Lux => https://lartu.itch.io/eternal-lux}}
is an old-school styled Android RPG, designed to look like a game from the
80's for the Apple II or MS-DOS like Ultima, with 16-color graphics and an
awesome MIDI soundtrack. It's written completely in Java-Processing without a
single class, for at the moment I did not know a thing about object oriented
programming. Nevertheless, Eternal Lux was downloaded by over 20.000 people
from all over the world and has received fairly positive reviews from an
assortment of gaming websites and users alike, holding a total score of
4.3 / 5 on the Google Play Store. It's free and weighs less than 800kb,
so go give it a try!

{{ subtitle Aidinia: An Epic Adventure! (Android, 2013) }}

{{ midimg ai.png }}

{{Aidinia - An Epic Adventure => https://lartu.itch.io/aidinia}}
was my first attempt at developing an Android RPG. It's an 8-bit-like
role-playing game written in Basic4Android and, being my first project on
the system, the controls are a little clunky. It also may or may not work well
on newer Android phones. Reviews were positive though and it holds a score of
4,1 / 5 stars. This was really painful to develop and it took me a very long
time, so I am quite happy with how the game turned out in the end, even if
it's not the best example of good game design choices. It was a paid title
for a long time, but due to a disagreement with the policies Google enforces
on their store I've decided to release it for free.

{{ subtitle Other Games }}
I have also made other games that are not worth mentioning or that have been sadly lost to time.
