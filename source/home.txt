# Lartunet

Hello! Welcome to the lartunet, Lartu's corner of the internet.
Here you'll find information about games and software I've worked on.
[Me? | about me] I make videogames and other code stuff. I love food and rainy days.
Thank you for passing by!

You may be interested in the [videogames] I've worked on,
or the [programming languages] I've developed.
Or maybe my [other projects].

I can also offer you my [List of Cool Links] and [Books].
Or you can just browse and see what you find.
If I have any thoughts I'd like to share, I'll post them [here | thoughts].

The lartunet is part of the [LOW TECH WEBRING | https://emreed.net/LowTech_Directory]!
Although the webring is __retired__ and no longer updated, you can continue exploring the
pages that comprised it using that link. It was a webring for homepages of people interested
in [low tech | https://walkerart.org/magazine/low-tech-magazine-kris-de-decker], small game tools,
and other forms of Web 1.0 inspired creativity. It was created
by Em, who started it because they were inspired [Olia Lialina's | https://art.teleportacia.org]
work documenting Geocities communities, Kris De Decker's work at
[LOW‚ÜêTECH Magazine | https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/], and their own internet childhood.
I like to keep this brief summary here as a testament of what it was.

If you want to create your own webring (and maybe invite me to join), you can do so with
[onionring.js | https://garlic.garden/onionring/], which is one of the most popular webring
solutions out there, and it's certainly low-tech.
