Hello! Welcome to the lartunet, Lartu's corner of the internet.
Here you'll find information about games and software I've worked on.
[Me? | about me] I make videogames and other code stuff. I love food and rainy days.
Thank you for passing by!

You may be interested in the [videogames] I've worked on,
or the [programming languages] I've developed.
Or maybe my [other projects].

I can also offer you my [List of Cool Links] and [Books].
Or you can just scroll and see what you find.
If I have any thoughts I'd like to share, I'll post them [here | thoughts].
