# Countries I've Been To

I really like travelling! This is a list of countries I've been to.
I should add the years to this list, but I don't quite have the dates
at hand right now.

ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡· Argentina, ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡º Australia, ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¹ Austria, ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡· Brazil,
ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦ Canada _*(again, just the airport)*_, ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡³ China, ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¿ Czech Republic, ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡ª Estonia,
ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡® Finland, ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡· France, ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡· Greece, ğŸ‡­ğŸ‡° Hong Kong, ğŸ‡­ğŸ‡º Hungary, ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¹ Italy, ğŸ‡¯ğŸ‡µ Japan,
ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡¿ New Zealand, ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡´ Norway, ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡¬ Singapore, ğŸ‡¿ğŸ‡¦ South Africa, ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡· South Korea, ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸ Spain,
ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ª Sweden, ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡¼ Taiwan _*(although just the airport)*_, ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡° Cook Islands,

ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ United States, ğŸ‡»ğŸ‡¦ Vatican City and ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¾ Uruguay.

I'd love to visit the ğŸ‡µğŸ‡­ Philippines someday, as so many Eterspire players live
there. I'd also like to go to ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡´ Macao, ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡± Chile, and ğŸ‡µğŸ‡ª Peru, off the top of my
head, but I'd like to visit most countries.
