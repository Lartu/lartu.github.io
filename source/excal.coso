{{p
Excal, the expense calculator,
is a tool I developed to keep track of my expenses.
}}

{{p
By analyzing what I spend my money on, I came up
with 25 categories all my expenses fall under. Using
these, I can calculate what I'm overspending on,
know how much money I have left, know if I have
gone overboard in some particular area, etc.
It has helped me gain some insight on
where my money is going.
}}

{{p
Since Excal is fine-tuned for my own needs, it's not
available for download; I may open-source it in the
future, but it's not a priority.
