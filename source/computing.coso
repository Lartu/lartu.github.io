{{ title philosophy }}

I separate {{videogames -> gamedev.coso}} from general software as a matter
of principle.
--
I tend to develop software that works on old software and unsupported
operating systems as well as modern computing platforms. Older computers
are incredible pieces of engineering that are still very powerful.
Software nowadays is too bloated and energy hungry.
Planned obsolescence {{is a thing => https://thedorkweb.substack.com/p/tales-from-the-dork-web-3}}.
--
Whenever possible, I like to develop software that's self contained and
dependency free. Software that you can uninstall by just
deleting the folder it is in.
--
The software I write is released for free and it's open-source. You are
welcome to download it, study it, modify if, break it and fix it. And,
if you want, to send a pull request to improve it for everybody.
--
My software runs, for the most part, on __*nix__ systems. Other systems
may or may not be supported on a case by case basis.

{{ title projects }}

::{{tmon => https://github.com/Lartu/tmon}}, the __[You]Tube Monitor__. It is a tool to make regular, local backups of your YouTube music playlists. It's pronounced __te-mon__, with __te__ like in __tetris__ and __mon_ like in __monitor__.

Right now I'm working on {{Eterspire (Beta II) => https://eterspire.com}}.

{{ title legacy projects }}

I've worked on multiple other {{programming projects -> legacy_computing.coso}}. 
Most of these aren't maintained anymore.
--
I've decided to reduce the number of projects I work on and maintain to leave more
time to work on more meaningful ones. Most of my legacy projects
reinvent the wheel in some way or another. I now try to work on software
that improves over existing alternatives in one way or another; or on
minimal, self-contained experiments.
