# Other Computer Projects

This section highlights some of my projects, though I've developed many others
that aren't included, either because they don't fit here or because I don't
find them significant enough to add. Oh bother.

* [ p5.clickable | https://github.com/Lartu/p5.clickable]
<br>__2019__
<br>Event driven, easy-to-use button library for P5.js. It even ended up in a P5 book. I'm in a book!
* [ Larturead | https://lartu.net/files/larturead.html]
<br>__2024__
<br>Web reimplementation of BeKnowledge, my reading tool for reading fast.
* [ dir | https://github.com/Lartu/dir]
<br>__2024__
<br>This is a tiny script I use to display the contents of a directory in my terminal in a fashion similar to MS-DOS's dir, which I like better than the usual ls.
* [ GBA-Dev | https://github.com/Lartu/GBA-Dev]
<br>__2023__
<br>Some tests and a half-baked (but very performant) pixel graphical library for Gameboy Advance game development.
* [ TunaBB | https://github.com/Lartu/TunaBB]
<br>__2023__
<br>A bulletin board designed from scratch to be self-contained, easy to deploy, easy to customize and easy to extend.
* [ Mitsubachi | https://github.com/Lartu/mitsubachi]
<br>__2019__
<br>Mitsubachi is a tiny and open chat protocol, designed to be minimal, easy to implement, easy to use and easy to understand. Mitsubachi supports nicknames, nickname changing, user-to-user messaging and channel / group (known in Mitsubachi as 'distribution lists') chat.
* [ tmon | https://github.com/Lartu/tmon]
<br>__2020__
<br>tmon, the (You)Tube Monitor, is a tool to make regular, local backups of your YouTube music playlists. It's pronounced te-mon, with te like in tetris and mon like in monitor.
* [ OpenNapkin | https://github.com/Lartu/OpenNapkin]
<br>__2020__
<br>OpenNapkin is a graphical Gopher client written in Gambas3. I wrote OpenNapkin because I wasn't able to find another Gopher client that wasn't written only for console or that wasn't part of a much bigger web-browsing suite.

I'm most probably forgetting something.
