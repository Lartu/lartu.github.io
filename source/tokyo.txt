# Places Worth Visiting in Tokyo

Many of my friends are going to Tokyo soon. This is a list of places
I’d recommend they visit while they’re there (and also a future reference for me when I go back!).
Most of the food places are chains that can be found all across Tokyo.

## Food Places I __Really__ Like

* **[Yoshinoya | https://www.yoshinoya.com/en/]**
    <br>A fast-food chain known for its affordable gyūdon. Amazing, amazing gyudon. Order it with raw egg and spring onions / scallions / cebollita de verdeo.
    Learn to recognize the logo, as it's almost always only in Japanese.
* **[Matsuya | https://www.matsuyafoods.co.jp/english/menu/]**
    <br>Same as Yoshinoya, also amazing and super affordable. Do try the same things there!
    Learn to recognize the logo, as it's almost always only in Japanese. Some open 24hs.
* **[Matsunoya | https://www.ecosia.org/images?q=matsunoya+japan+tonkatsu ]**
    <br>Not to be confused with Matsuya. Amazing, affordable tonkatsu.
    Learn to recognize the logo, as it's almost always only in Japanese.
* **[Sukiya | https://www.sukiya.jp/en/]**
    <br>Same as Yoshinoya and Matsuya, although I like it less.
    Learn to recognize the logo, as it's almost always only in Japanese. Some open 24hs.
* **[Sushiro | https://www.akindo-sushiro.co.jp/en/ ]**
    <br>On-demand conveyor belt sushi. Great and affordable. The logo is always in japanese.
* **[ CoCo Ichibanya | https://www.ichibanya.co.jp/english/]**
    <br>Curry chain. Amazing, amazing curry. Would go everyday. Try the extras!
* **[ Kura Sushi | https://www.kurasushi.co.jp//]**
    <br>Same as Sushiro, although I think I like sushiro better. You can win prizes when you order different dishes.
* **[Rāmen Kagetsu Arashi | https://www.kagetsu.co.jp/menu/english/] **
    <br>Amazing ramen.
* **[Jonathan's | https://www.skylark.co.jp/en/jonathan/]**
    <br>Best place to have breakfast. Very affordable if you go while the breakfast menu is available (iirc until 10:30 am or 11 am).
    I haven't tried their non-breakfast food.
* **[Café Gusto | https://www.skylark.co.jp/gusto/index.html]**
    <br>Owned by the same people as Jonathan's, great curry.

## Other Food Places Worth Mentioning

* **[Mi Choripán | https://michoripan.com]**
    <br>Choripanes y empanadas de queso. Impresionante, el flaco se vino a Buenos Aires a estudiar a un puestito de la costanera
    y después se volvió a Japón y se puso este local. Todo 100% auténtico, es excelente, vale la pena visitarlo si no queda muy
    de trasmano.
* **[Caffè Veloce | https://c-united.co.jp/veloce/]**
    <br>Café y sanguchitos de miga mostly. Parece sacado de Microcentro.
* **[Hub | https://www.pub-hub.co.jp/en/]**
    <br>British pub chain. A bit expensive for what it is, but it's great and worth a visit, especially if tired and cold.

Avoid **[MOS Burger | https://www.mos.co.jp/global/]** like the plague. **[Saizeriya | https://www.saizeriya.co.jp]** is also
worth mentioning, as it is what Japan thinks Italian food is like. The food is quite bad though.

## Shopping

* Tokyo Sky Tree
* Hobby Off / Book Off
* Janpara
* **Yodobashi Camera Akiba**
    <br>Particularly the Akiba station one. It's huge, it has everything. Worth spending a whole day in there. Also visit the Uniqlo
    that's on the upmost floor. It also has a food court (but it closes rather early, like all food places in Japan).
* Uniqlo Akiba (literally above the Yodobashi Camera Akiba)
* Pokémon Center
* Daiso

There are many things to do in Tokyo (obviously). This list is mostly about
food places and other niche shops and places I particularly liked. If you are planning a trip
to Tokyo, I'd recommend you take a loot at the [Tokyo Lonely Planet Guide (in Spanish) | https://www.lonelyplanet.es/asia/japon/tokio]
and the books they sell (the books are really worth it, specially __"Tokio de cerca"__).

I also recommend downloading the full Japanese language pack on Google Translate or Apple Translate,
so you can translate without needing internet, and also use the camera to take pictures of signs or
text and read what they say.

And download the full map of Tokyo on Google Maps so you can navigate offline.

The aquariums are also really nice.
