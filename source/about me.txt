# About Me

Hello, I'm Lartu. This is my personal website.

I'm mostly a game developer. Mostly, because I work on other stuff from time to time.
I co-founded [ Stonehollow Workshop | https://www.stonehollow-workshop.com/ ].

I have studied Computer Science and Anthropology of Religion,
and I have a license to pilot sailships. I also have a driving license!
I can speak English, Spanish and Japanese.

Find me on [X (Twitter) | https://www.x.com/martulartu], 
[GitHub | https://www.github.com/lartu], and [Itch.io | https://lartu.itch.io/].
You may also e-mail lartu (at) lartu dot net.

If you see a lartu anywhere else, that's also probably me.
