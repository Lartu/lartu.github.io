## MMORPGs & Game Development

% "There also seems to be a difference in philosophy when it comes to player retention. When FF14 starts losing players, Yoshi-P doesn't panic and go 'We must retain what's left!' he stops and asks 'Okay, what are we doing wrong that is making them leave?' He also doesn't panic over natural churn. In fact he's said in interviews 'Go ahead, leave for a bit, play some other games, there's lots out there, we'll be waiting when you get back.' There's no pressure to log in every day or FOMO."
    <br>_*Interview on the development of Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn*_

From Daniel Lisi, World of Warcraft, Boss Fight Books:

% "Our guild’s World of Warcraft stories contained much more meaning than the game itself. They all pertained to what we had done together: something funny someone did during a raid, embarrassing gossip overheard in chat, or momentous triumphs we had made as one cohesive unit. We regaled ourselves with tales of our illustrious careers together in Azeroth. These were stories steeped in personality and emotion, evoking deep sentiment from the group."
% "When you are considering adding new mechanics, you can ask, “How will this mechanic improve, complicate, or otherwise impact the game’s loop?” After all, the aspect of the game that matters most is whatever the player is spending the most time doing."
% "World of Warcraft requires a different formula: kill stuff → level up → get loot → repeat until endgame; then kill stuff → get loot → kill harder stuff → get better loot → repeat. The 'meaning of life' in World of Warcraft is to grow a powerful character, defeat the endgame content, and gear up enough to repeat the loop when new challenges arrive."
% "I similarly remember the euphoric rush of my guild’s first boss kills: the onscreen event of a boss’s health hitting 0%, the ensuing screams over Ventrilo, the praise between guildmates, the distribution of loot. It was a party. This is what hardcore raiders returned to, over and over again—not only the experience of the kill, but the reveling in it, the praise and celebration amongst your team. What a loop."
% "As Jonathan Blow points out, “MMOs are notorious for having relatively empty gameplay, but keeping players hooked with constant fake rewards—this creates ‘the treadmill.’ Rewards are a way of lying to the player so they feel good and continue to play the game.” He noted some extreme examples of this, such as reported incidents of Chinese and Korean MMO players dying at the computer. “As long as players are hooked, it doesn’t matter how good the core gameplay is. As long as they want to get the nicer sword, they’ll still play the game, and as long as they play it’s all the same to us as designers—I’m sure at this point, people think I’m needlessly babbling on about this point. But I want to put forth this question: Would they still play a game if it took out all the scheduled rewards?”"
% "[In games], basically there are two parts: what __gets__ me playing the game and what __keeps__ me playing the game."

## Others

% "Anything on deck is sacrificial."
    <br>_*Lin Pardey*_
% "The other part of the idea relates to the term 'generation.' Sociologists and market researchers have established a new, primarily applicative definition, where a generation is not based on age, time, or genetic compatibility, but rather on the similarity of lived experiences; where what classifies its members is that they have or share the same experiences."
% "When something is 'kino,' it means it has artistic merit."
    <br>_*Moncholo*_
% "A programming language is low-level when it requires attention to the irrelevant."
    <br>_*Alan J. Perlis*_
% "Yes, because it may very well happen that by not trying something, I'm missing out on an immense subtree of possible paths that hook me in."
    <br>_*GS (in reference to buying material things)*_
% "By buying something that doesn’t —cannot— overdo what I wanted it to do, it reminded me how I see life and how I actually want to live it."
    <br>_*[This $17 watch is (slowly) replacing my phone | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE8T7mVO9jU], by Good At Life, in reference to how a phone can tell the time, but you’re always fighting the temptation to start messing around with it—and even if you usually win, eventually you lose and end up scrolling through Instagram; whereas a watch can’t do anything else, and therefore doesn’t work against you by trying to tempt you.*_
