:: Finish a project before optimizing it. A released project is better than a well-polished one that no-one will ever see.
:: Most software out there is messy. That's why it's out there.

:: If you feel like everyone hates you, you need to sleep.
:: If you feel like you have everyone else, you need to eat.
:: If you are pulling an all-nighter, keep a bottle of water by your side. It's very easy to forget to drink water while working late.
