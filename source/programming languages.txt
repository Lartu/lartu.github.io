# Programming Languages & Esolangs

This section talks abouts the programming languages I've developed
(to varying degrees of [ esotericism | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language ]).

* [ Makompile ]
<br>__2025__
<br>A static website, book and / or documentation writing system. This site is
written using makompile.
* [ LDPL | https://www.ldpl-lang.org/ ]
<br>__2019__
<br>Lartu's Definitive Programming Language, or LDPL the Dinosaur Programming 
Language. A COBOL-inspired programming language, designed to be expressive, readable, fast and easy to learn. In other words: a masterpiece. Considered complete and in minimal evolution mode since LDPL 5. One of the best things I've ever made, for a number of reasons.
* [ Katalyn | https://github.com/Lartu/Katalyn/ ]
<br>__2024__
<br>The Katalyn programming language is a powerful scripting language designed 
to pair the simplicity of Lua with the power of Perl. It integrates an intuitive
syntax with a comprehensive, batteries-included standard library of useful
functions. Whether you are writing console scripts, calling APIs or parsing
text, Katalyn helps you get things done without getting in the way!
* [ Polaris | https://github.com/Lartu/polaris ]
<br>__2020__
<br>A minimal, experimental stack-based, concatenative, interpreted programming
language with strings as its only data type. Written in C++98, designed to run
on Unix systems, backported to MS-DOS.
* [ WebSCFL | https://github.com/Lartu/WebSCFL ]
<br>__2024__
<br>WebSCFL stands for Web Sectioned Command First Language. It's a programming
language designed to make simple Prof. Dr. Style websites. This website used to
be written and compiled using WebSCFL.
* [ Polaris Twist | https://github.com/Lartu/Polaris-Twist ]
<br>__2024__
<br>Polaris Twist is a refreshing stack-based, concatenative, interpreted
programming language with strings as its only data type. It's a revision of
my original Polaris, much faster and with Foreign Function Interface support.
It has been designed to be small in size and minimal in language features.
Written in C++98, so it can probably be compiled with any C++ compiler out there.
* [ Nari (2023) | https://github.com/Lartu/nari2023 ]
<br>__2023__
<br>Nari (2023) is a new iteration of my Nari programming language.
I develop it to relax, so I call Nari 'programming language programming as
therapy'. Nari is inspired by Forth, or how I imagine Forth to be, as I've never
written a single line of Forth. Nari is a weakly typed language. Its only data
types are strings and integers. I don't know if it's fast or not (it probably
isn't). I might expand it over time. I also might not.

And many others not worth mentioning.
