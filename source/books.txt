# Curated Reads

Also known as 'Books I Like So Much I'd Constantly Nag You to Read Them'.

* **World of Warcraft**
<br>__Daniel Lisi, 2016, Boss Fight Books__
<br>With over 100 million accounts and $10 billion in revenue, World of Warcraft
is the most-subscribed MMORPG and highest-grossing game ever. Daniel Lisi, a
lifelong WoW player turned game developer, explores its origins, addictive gameplay,
social impact, and the deep connections forged within its world.
* **EverQuest**
<br>__Matthew S. Smith, 2024, Boss Fight Books__
<br>«You're in our world now.» Sony's 1999 ad for EverQuest invited players into
a groundbreaking MMORPG. It became the top subscription game in North America for
five years until World of Warcraft took over. Journalist Matthew S. Smith explores
its creation, impact on gaming addiction, and lasting legacy.
* **.hack//AI Buster**
<br>__Tatsuya Hamazaki, 2002. My edition is by Tokyopop, published in 2006.__
<br>AI Buster, the prequel to .hack follows the avatar Albireo, as he tries to
discover why The World -- the most advanced game ever created is in danger of
falling apart. I haven't played the hack games as of this writing, but this book
is an amazing MMORPG read regardless. Also my favourite book.
* **Designing Virtual Worlds**
<br>__Richard Bartle, 2003. Available [here | https://archive.org/details/designing-virtual-worlds].__
<br>Richard Bartle's Designing Virtual Worlds is a foundational, widely praised
guide to virtual world design, blending theory and practice while expanding his
player type model and emphasizing self-exploration as the core purpose of these
spaces.
