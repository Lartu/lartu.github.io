<h1>2021-05-24: Worldbuilding</h1>

With my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/tejo240" class="external" target=_blank>Tejo</a>, we are working on this
indie MMORPG called <a href="https://eterspire.com" class="external" target=_blank>Eterspire</a>. We are very close
to releasing the second open-beta of the game. We are so
excited about that!
<div class="split"></div>
I began developing Eterspire by myself in October last year. I've always
wanted to make my own MMORPG! And so I did. I believe
it was in February that I released the first beta. A lot of people signed
up.
Much fun was had. The game, however, was very limited, so I joined forces with
Tejo to work on a second version. We spent the past four months tweaking
the engine, adding new features and fixing my less-than-ideal code.
And yesterday, we completed the last
non-content-releated task, so today we met to discuss the actual content of the
game. The world, its inhabitants, quests, treasures and monsters.

We had an amazing time, ate lunch and brainstormed the weirdest
ideas.

He has a cute, tiny cat. She spent the afternoon with us, too.

At around 5 PM, the final sketches for the world were complete, so I
left Tejo's house. On the way back to my apartment, I heard somebody calling me.
<i>Could you lend us a hand?</i>, they said.
<div class="split"></div>
The calling voice was that of a mechanic from a car repair shop.
His associates and him needed help pushing a car up a ramp and into their workshop. I grouped
with them, along with an old-man that was also passing-by, and we got
the vehicle into their shop. Fun! While not something <i>that</i>
out of the ordinary, this was the kind of experience I was looking forward for.
For a moment, I met new people and did something I never do in my usual
routine. I regret not taking a picture with them for this article,
but I didn't want to be a nuisance. Next time I will.

The leaves on the street scattered by the storm from <a href="log_2021-05-22.html">the other day</a> were still there, although it seemed somebody had
been cleaning them up. Autumn.

<div class="split"></div>

When I got home, I fired up my computer and began turning the ideas we'd
discussed about into a reality. We are so close to the release, yet there's still
so much to do. I can barely wait.

Tomorrow we are going to a farmers' market and I'll meet my family for lunch afterwards,
with strict sanitary precautions. I hope after all of that I'll have something
new to write about.
