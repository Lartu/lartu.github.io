<h1>2021-05-24: Worldbuilding</h1>

<p>With my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/tejo240" class=external target=_blank>Tejo</a>, we are working on this indie MMORPG called <a href="https://eterspire.com" class=external target=_blank>Eterspire</a>. We are very close to releasing the second open-beta of the game. We are so excited about that!</p>

<p>I began developing Eterspire by myself in October last year. I've always wanted to make my own MMORPG! And so I did. I believe it was in February that I released the first beta. A lot of people signed up. Much fun was had. The game, however, was very limited, so I joined forces with Tejo to work on a second version. We spent the past four months tweaking the engine, adding new features and fixing my less-than-ideal code. And yesterday, we completed the last non-content-releated task, so today we met to discuss the actual content of the game. The world, its inhabitants, quests, treasures and monsters.</p>

<p>We had an amazing time, ate lunch and brainstormed the weirdest ideas.</p>

<p>He has a cute, tiny cat. She spent the afternoon with us, too.</p>

<p>At around 5 PM, the final sketches for the world were complete, so I left Tejo's house. On the way back to my apartment, I heard somebody calling me. <i>Could you lend us a hand?</i>, they said.</p>

<p>The calling voice was that of a mechanic from a car repair shop. His associates and him needed help pushing a car up a ramp and into their workshop. I grouped with them, along with an old-man that was also passing-by, and we got the vehicle into their shop. Fun! While not something <i>that</i> out of the ordinary, this was the kind of experience I was looking forward for. For a moment, I met new people and did something I never do in my usual routine. I regret not taking a picture with them for this article, but I didn't want to be a nuisance. Next time I will.</p>

<p>The leaves on the street scattered by the storm from <a href="log_2021-05-22.html" >the other day</a> were still there, although it seemed somebody had been cleaning them up. Autumn.</p>

<p>When I got home, I fired up my computer and began turning the ideas we'd discussed about into a reality. We are so close to the release, yet there's still so much to do. I can barely wait.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we are going to a farmers' market and I'll meet my family for lunch afterwards, with strict sanitary precautions. I hope after all of that I'll have something new to write about.</p>
