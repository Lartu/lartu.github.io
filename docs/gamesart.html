<h1>games and art</h1>

<div class="bigimg"><img src ="images/c_E79I59.gif" title="E79I59" alt="Image: E79I59"><small>— E79I59  (GIF) - <a href="images/E79I59.jpg" target=_blank>view original</a> (110 KiB, JPG)</small></div>

<h2>videogames</h2>

Most of my free time is spent developing <a href="gamedev.html">videogames</a>.
You can also find my games at <a href="https://lartu.itch.io" class="external" target=_blank>lartu.itch.io</a>.
<div class="split"></div>
Most of my games are released for free, although donations are always welcome
on platforms that support them. Except in some very rare instances, no source
code is provided for them.


<h2>photography</h2>

I'm not a photographer by any means. When traveling I do like to take pictures
of places I like. Some of my photos have been uploaded to adorn the lartunet.
I haven't made a full album available publicly yet, nor I plan to. This doesn't
mean I won't in the future.
<div class="split"></div>
The names of the photos depicted on this website are a hash based on their
original filename to mantain consistency, general aesthetic and for
convenience. There's no real meaning to them. There's also no actual meaning
to the photos I display here, just places I enjoyed observing.


<h2>music</h2>

I write music for my videogames. There are hours and hours of soundtracks that
I haven't uploaded anywhere yet, but I might in the future. 

Maybe on <a href="ideas.html">Bandcamp</a>.
The soundtrack for
all my games is available to download for free on their respective
<a href="https://lartu.itch.io" class="external" target=_blank>itch.io</a> subsites.
<div class="split"></div>
At some point I also attempted to write lo-fi hip hop with
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pzCy--ItfE" class="external" target=_blank>Polaris Quine</a>
and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLNvlRiahDo" class="external" target=_blank>MOXWave</a>.
<div class="split"></div>
I <a href="ideas.html">would love</a> to write a tracker someday.

<h2>recipes</h2>

«<i>Of course, food is a human need and can be seen as a science, but we have
transformed food and its preparation into something more than just a basic
human need. We have made eating an experience, and the preparation of food an
art form</i>»
<div class="split"></div>
Sometimes I enjoy cooking (and I do surely enjoy eating even more).
I have compiled a few recipes I enjoy in the <a href="cookbook.html">cookbook</a>.
