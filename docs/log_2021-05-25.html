<h1>2021-05-25: Farmers' Market</h1>

I had been looking forward to this day for almost a week. I had found out
a farmers' market gathered every tuesday a few blocks from home and I was
very excited to visit them. The experience was, unfortunately, somewhat
lackluster.

<div class="bigimg"><img src ="images/c_M93R95.JPEG" title="M93R95" alt="Image: M93R95"><small>— M93R95  (JPEG) - <a href="images/M93R95.JPG" target=_blank>view original</a> (3221 KiB, JPG)</small></div>

The place was well stocked, but there were very few stalls. I had been to
some of these markets in the past and there were more, but maybe that's
because of the pandemic.

<div class="split"></div>

One man got mad at me for taking pictures. I realize I should've asked
in the first place, but my mind was somewhere else. In any case,
that didn't give the market any extra points.

<div class="split"></div>

My original idea was to come to this market and buy the groceries I'd need
for the whole week. However, my usual shops seem to stock the same stuff
they sell here, and I like supporting the small stores I tend to go to,
so I don't believe my shopping habits will change a bit. Which is a little
disappointing because I was looking for something new.

The leek I started growing some days ago has grown a lot! We were quite
surprised at this. I don't know the first thing about plants, so I was
expecting it to grow at a much slower pace. Nature is amazing.

I also put on, for the first time, a pair of socks I'd bought in Australia
about two years ago. They are decorated with rainbowy jelly beans.
I love colorful socks. When I moved by myself, I left
the plain-colored pairs behind, so now my feet are always clad in pretty
patterns.

On the way home I saw a flock of pidgeons sitting on a phone line.
Their picture ended up looking like a lost
Windows 7 wallpaper. You can click <i>view original</i> to open the
picture in full colour.
