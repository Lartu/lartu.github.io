        pair the simplicity of Lua with the power of Perl. It integrates an intuitive syntax
        with a comprehensive, batteries-included standard library of useful functions.
        Whether you are writing console scripts, calling APIs or parsing text, Katalyn
        helps you get things done without getting in the way!</p><h3><a href="https://github.com/Lartu/WebSCFL/" target=_blank>WebSCFL</a> <small>(2024)</small></h3><a href="https://github.com/Lartu/WebSCFL/" target=_blank><img src="images/webscfl.png" /></a><p>WebSCFL stands for Web Sectioned Command First Language.
        It's a programming language designed to make simple Prof. Dr. Style websites.
        This website used to be written and compiled using WebSCFL.</p><h3><a href="https://github.com/Lartu/Polaris-Twist/" target=_blank>Polaris Twist</a> <small>(2024)</small></h3><a href="https://github.com/Lartu/Polaris-Twist/" target=_blank><img src="images/polaris2.png" /></a><p>Polaris Twist is a refreshing stack-based, concatenative,
        interpreted programming language with strings as its only data type.
        It's a revision of my original Polaris, much faster and with Foreign
        Function Interface support. It has been designed to be small in size
        and minimal in language features. Written in C++98, so it can probably
        be compiled with any C++ compiler out there.</p><h3><a href="https://github.com/Lartu/nari2023" target=_blank>Nari</a> <small>(2023)</small></h3><a href="https://github.com/Lartu/nari2023" target=_blank><img src="images/nari.png" /></a><p>Nari (2023) is a new iteration of my Nari programming language.
        I develop it to relax, so I call Nari 'programming language programming as therapy'.
        Nari is inspired by Forth, or how I imagine Forth to be, as I've never written a
        single line of Forth. Nari is a weakly typed language. Its only data types are
        strings and integers. I don't know if it's fast or not (it probably isn't).
        I might expand it over time. I also might not.</p><p><small>Nari was also the guinea pig in the picture above (2012-2020).</small></p><h3><a href="https://github.com/Lartu/polaris" target=_blank>Polaris</a> <small>(2020)</small></h3><a href="https://github.com/Lartu/polaris" target=_blank><img src="images/polaris1.png" /></a><p>A minimal, experimental stack-based, concatenative, interpreted programming
        language with strings as its only data type. Written in C++98, designed to run on
        Unix systems, backported to MS-DOS.</p><h3><a href="https://www.ldpl-lang.org/" target=_blank>LDPL</a> <small>(2019)</small></h3><a href="https://www.ldpl-lang.org/" target=_blank><img src="images/ldpl.png" /></a><p>A COBOL-inspired programming language, designed to be expressive, readable,
        fast and easy to learn. Considered complete and in minimal evolution mode since
        LDPL 5. One of the best things I've ever made, for a number of reasons.</p><center><p><small>Webpage compiled on Sat Aug 31 03:17:49 -03 2024.</small></p><a href="https://github.com/Lartu/katalyn" target=_blank><img src="images/katbadge.png" /></a></center>
