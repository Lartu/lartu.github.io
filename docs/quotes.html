<h2>Management</h2>
<p>Some other management quotes are in the business section below. I should move them here.</p>

    <br><small>Josh Strife Hayes</small>

"Your vision must be exciting and there has to be a payoff in it for everybody. When you plan like that, everybody can see themselves in your vision."
    <br><small>(I can't find the source for this one.)</small>
</li>
<li>

"Your vision must be resilient: it has to withstand cultural, political and technological change."
    <br><small>(I can't find the source for this one.)</small>
</li>
<li>

"Your vision has to be inclusive: the very words you choose have to be an invitation to those who believe in what you believe. Nobody must end up feeling a second citizen in their own company."
    <br><small>(I can't find the source for this one.)</small>
</li>
<li>

"Your vision has to be service oriented. In every relationship there’s a benefactor and a benefiter. Service orientation means that the primary benefit goes to those other than the contributor."
    <br><small>(I can't find the source for this one.)</small>
</li>
<li>

"If you want to set a trend, you have to tell the customer, “I’m going to offer you this experience, and you’re going to like it.”"
    <br><small>An Uber driver, Easter 2024</small>
</li>
<li>

"Union relations are based on cooperation between managers and workers. Collective bargaining negotiations revolve around employee security. For example, staff cuts can only occur in severe economic crises and, before resorting to layoffs, managers' salaries and hiring levels will be reduced."
</li>
<li>

"Managers must take into account two types of factors when organizing. First, they must define the organization’s goals, its strategic plans to pursue those goals, and the capacity of their organizations to implement those strategic plans."

"In the early 20th century, various authors attempted to determine the maximum number of people a manager could supervise, and many concluded that the universal maximum was six."
</li>
<li>

"Just as the balance sheet describes a company’s financial situation at a given moment, the income statement summarizes the company’s financial performance over an interval. Thus, the income statement says: 'This is the amount of money I earned during this period,' instead of 'This is the amount of money we are worth now.'"
</li>
<li>

"People tend to join teams whose members they identify with or admire. Thus, the organization might want to start by trying to attract employees who share certain key values."
</li>
<li>

"The most effective leaders established supportive relationships with their employees, tended to rely on group decisions instead of personal ones, and encouraged employees to set high performance goals and achieve them."
</li>
<li>

"Transactional leaders determine what employees must do to achieve the organization’s and their own objectives, classify those requirements, and help employees believe they can achieve their goals if they make the necessary effort. Transformational leaders, on the other hand, 'motivate us to do more than we originally expected to do,' because they enhance our appreciation of the importance and value of our tasks."
</li>
<li>

"To get people talking about you, you have to do something worth talking about."

<h2>MMORPGs</h2>

<li>

"There also seems to be a difference in philosophy when it comes to player retention. When FF14 starts losing players, Yoshi-P doesn't panic and go 'We must retain what's left!' he stops and asks 'Okay, what are we doing wrong that is making them leave?' He also doesn't panic over natural churn. In fact he's said in interviews 'Go ahead, leave for a bit, play some other games, there's lots out there, we'll be waiting when you get back.' There's no pressure to log in every day or FOMO."
    <br><small>Interview on the development of Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn</small>
</li>
</ol>
<p>From Daniel Lisi, World of Warcraft, Boss Fight Books:</p>
<ol>
<li>

"Our guild’s World of Warcraft stories contained much more meaning than the game itself. They all pertained to what we had done together: something funny someone did during a raid, embarrassing gossip overheard in chat, or momentous triumphs we had made as one cohesive unit. We regaled ourselves with tales of our illustrious careers together in Azeroth. These were stories steeped in personality and emotion, evoking deep sentiment from the group."
</li>
<li>

"When you are considering adding new mechanics, you can ask, “How will this mechanic improve, complicate, or otherwise impact the game’s loop?” After all, the aspect of the game that matters most is whatever the player is spending the most time doing."
</li>
<li>

"World of Warcraft requires a different formula: kill stuff → level up → get loot → repeat until endgame; then kill stuff → get loot → kill harder stuff → get better loot → repeat. The 'meaning of life' in World of Warcraft is to grow a powerful character, defeat the endgame content, and gear up enough to repeat the loop when new challenges arrive."
</li>
<li>

"I similarly remember the euphoric rush of my guild’s first boss kills: the onscreen event of a boss’s health hitting 0%, the ensuing screams over Ventrilo, the praise between guildmates, the distribution of loot. It was a party. This is what hardcore raiders returned to, over and over again—not only the experience of the kill, but the reveling in it, the praise and celebration amongst your team. What a loop."
</li>
<li>

"As Jonathan Blow points out, “MMOs are notorious for having relatively empty gameplay, but keeping players hooked with constant fake rewards—this creates ‘the treadmill.’ Rewards are a way of lying to the player so they feel good and continue to play the game.” He noted some extreme examples of this, such as reported incidents of Chinese and Korean MMO players dying at the computer. “As long as players are hooked, it doesn’t matter how good the core gameplay is. As long as they want to get the nicer sword, they’ll still play the game, and as long as they play it’s all the same to us as designers—I’m sure at this point, people think I’m needlessly babbling on about this point. But I want to put forth this question: Would they still play a game if it took out all the scheduled rewards?”"
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Others</h2>
<ol>
<li>

"Anything on deck is sacrificial."
    <br><small>Lin Pardey</small>
</li>
<li>

"The other part of the idea relates to the term 'generation.' Sociologists and market researchers have established a new, primarily applicative definition, where a generation is not based on age, time, or genetic compatibility, but rather on the similarity of lived experiences; where what classifies its members is that they have or share the same experiences."
</li>
<li>

"When something is 'kino,' it means it has artistic merit."
    <br><small>Moncholo</small>
</li>
<li>

"A programming language is low-level when it requires attention to the irrelevant."
    <br><small>Alan J. Perlis</small>
</li>
<li>

"Yes, because it may very well happen that by not trying something, I'm missing out on an immense subtree of possible paths that hook me in."
    <br><small>GS (in reference to buying material things)</small>
</li>
<li>

"By buying something that doesn’t —cannot— overdo what I wanted it to do, it reminded me how I see life and how I actually want to live it."
    <br><small><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE8T7mVO9jU" target=_blank>This $17 watch is (slowly) replacing my phone</a>, by Good At Life, in reference to how a phone can tell the time, but you’re always fighting the temptation to start messing around with it—and even if you usually win, eventually you lose and end up scrolling through Instagram; whereas a watch can’t do anything else, and therefore doesn’t work against you by trying to tempt you.</small>
