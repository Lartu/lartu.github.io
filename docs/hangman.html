<h1>Hangman Rules</h1>

We've all played Hangman before. The rules are simple and we all know them,
but not quite. At first it may seem that there's no ambiguity in the rules of
the Hangman game, but if we look deeper into them, problems start arising.

<div class="bigimg"><img src ="images/c_J86I14.jpg" title="J86I14" alt="Image: J86I14"><small>— J86I14  (JPEG) - <a href="images/J86I14.jpg" target=_blank>view original</a> (778 KiB, JPG)</small></div>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le5uGqHKll8&ab_channel=janMisali" class="external" target=_blank>This video</a>
explains the problem in great detail. It also gives each player a name that I
will replicate here, as that makes things easier. The player guessing the word
is called the <i>guesser</i>, while the player that has chosen the word will be
known as the <i>executioner</i>.
<div class="split"></div>
If the video is not available or you don't want to watch it, it suffices to say
that, for example, the rules don't prevent the executioner from changing the
word during gameplay to make it harder for the guesser to win, nor do they
state what classifies as a valid word, nor how many body parts to add to the
hangman when a mistake is made. Thus, the need for an unambiguous ruleset.
<div class="split"></div>
I have also added a few new rules of my own to make the game more interesting
for the executioner, as the base game allows for zero interaction of the player
after a word has been choosen.

<h2>the rules</h2>

(1) The game requires two parties to begin. The parties may be one player each
or more. If the game is played by parties of more than one player each (teams),
the rules are still the same, but party members can talk between them before
deciding how to proceed on their turn.

<div class="split"></div>
(2) Players decide among themselves (a simple game of chance like throwing a
coin or rolling a dice might be used) on who's going to be the executioner and
who's going to be the guesser.

<div class="split"></div>
(3) Both players then pick the minimum and maximum length for valid words. A
valid word might not have less than 3 letters.

<div class="split"></div>
(4) A number between the minimum and maximum length of valid words (both ends
included) is picked at random. Ways of picking the length might include throwing
a dice, using a digital random number generator, throwing a coin multiple times
and counting the number of heads, etc. What's important is that the resulting
number is effectively random.

<div class="split"></div>
(5) Once the length of the word has been set, the executioner must select a
letter at random. The letter must be a valid (more on this later) letter.
The guesser shouldn't be able to see what letter has been chosen, but the
executioner must keep the medium that gave them said letter intact to prevent
cheating. For example: if a random letter app on a smartphone has been used to
pick the letter, the executioner should place the phone face down on the table
once the letter has been obtained so, if in doubt, the guesser can confirm that
the letter the executioner claims to be the letter selected is the one actually
rendered by the random letter app. Other way of picking a random letter could
be to have a bag of letter cards (cardboard cards with a letter written on one
side) and have the executioner put their hand into the bag, take a random card,
look at it and place it face down on the table.

<div class="split"></div>
(6) Then the executioner picks a word that is as long as the randomly chosen
word length from step (4) and includes the random letter picked in step (5) at
least once. For example, if the word length is 6 and the letter is T, a valid
word might be <i>potato</i>. The executioner writes the word on a piece of paper
(without the guesser seeing it) and places it face down on the table to prevent
cheating.

<div class="split"></div>
(7) The executioner then writes down a number of underscores to indicate the
guesser how many characters long is the word. In the case of the word <i>potato</i>,
the executioner should write <code>_ _ _ _ _ _</code>.

<div class="split"></div>
(8) The executioner then draws the gallows next to the underscores. The correct
way to draw the gallows is <i>state 0</i> of the picture below.

<div class="split"></div>
(9) The guesser picks a letter and informs it to the executioner. If the
letter is in the word, the executioner writes it in the underscored position
the letter would be at, every time it appears in the word. For example, if
the guesser guessed the letter <i>O</i>, the executioner should write <code>_ O _ _ _ O</code>.

<div class="split"></div>
(10) If the letter the guesser has picked is not in the word, the executioner
writes the letter next to the gallows and
draws the next piece of the hangman (effectively moving to the next "<i>state</i>"
of the hangman). The correct way to draw the hangman's body, state by state,
is depicted in the picture below.

<div class="bigimg"><img src ="images/c_V02S49.jpg" title="V02S49" alt="Image: V02S49"><small>— V02S49  (JPEG) - <a href="images/V02S49.jpg" target=_blank>view original</a> (2176 KiB, JPG)</small></div>

<div class="split"></div>
(12) If the executioner has drawn all the hangman (that is, when the hangman
is the same as <i>state 5</i>) the game ends and the guesser losses. The letter the
executioner got and the word they picked are revealed to the guesser. Once the
guesser confirms that no cheating nor foul play have taken place, the
executioner scores one point.

<div class="split"></div>
(13) If the guesser has guessed the whole word (that is, when no underscores
without a letter written on them remain), the guesser wins.
The letter the executioner got and the word they picked are revealed to the guesser.
Once the
guesser confirms that no cheating nor foul play have taken place, the
guesser scores one point.

<div class="split"></div>
(11) Steps (7) to (10) are repeated until one of the two players scores a point.

<div class="split"></div>
(12) The player who was the guesser then takes the place of the executioner and
vice versa. Then the game is repeated from step (4).

<div class="split"></div>
(13) At the end of six rounds (once evey player has been the executioner and
the guesser three times), the player with the highest score wins. If both
players have the same score, two more rounds are played (so that both players
can be guesser and executioner once) until at the end of the rounds a player
has more points than their opponent. In this scenario, once more the player
with more points is declared the winner.

<h2>valid words</h2>

Valid words are words contained in a dictionary <i>previously</i> decided upon
by both players. If no dictionary has been chosen, the following dictionaries
are to be used by default:

<div class="split"></div>

<div class='listitem'><span class='listmark'>※</span> For an <b>English</b> game, the <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/" class="external" target=_blank>Cambridge Dictionary</a>.</div>
<div class='listitem'><span class='listmark'>※</span> For an <b>Spanish</b> game, the <a href="https://www.rae.es/" class="external" target=_blank>Diccionario de la Real Academia Española</a>.</div>

<div class="split"></div>

A game of Hangman must be played in only one language, chosen by both players
before the start of the game.

<div class="split"></div>

For any other languages, please send me a suggestion and I'll add it.

<h2>valid letters</h2>

Letters should be any of the glyphs considered letters for the language of choice.
What is and what isn't a letter varies from language to language. In multiple
languages, ñ is not a letter by itself but an n with a tilde (~) on top. In
Spanish, however, it is a letter by its own right and its part of the alphabet.
Thus, in a Spanish game of Hangman, ñ is to be considered a valid letter.
<div class="split"></div>
In English, é is sometimes used (as in <i>café</i>). However, é is not part of the
English alphabet, e is. é is just an e with a diacritic, so it's not a valid
letter. If the chosen word was <i>café</i>, the guesser must guess the letter e
to guess the é from café and any other e-s in the word. By no means should they
have to pick é. Another example of English non-letters are apostrophes.
<div class="split"></div>
Characters like !, ?, (, ), etc, that are not part of valid words nor
alphabets are, of course, not valid letters.
<div class="split"></div>
The wisest thing to do would be to agree beforehand with your opponent
which letters you are going to consider valid. Specially if you are playing
in a language that does not have an official alphabet.

<h2>clarifications</h2>

If you feel the rules need further clarifications on any particular points,
please <a href="mailto:lartu@lartu.net" class="external" target=_blank>let me know</a> so I can disambiguate them
further.
