			<description><![CDATA[<h1>2021-05-24: Worldbuilding</h1>

With my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/tejo240"" target=_blank>Tejo</a>, we are working on this
indie MMORPG called <a href="https://eterspire.com"" target=_blank>Eterspire</a>. We are very close
to releasing the second open-beta of the game. We are so
excited about that!
<br><br>
I began developing Eterspire by myself in October last year. I've always
wanted to make my own MMORPG! And so I did. I believe
it was in February that I released the first beta. A lot of people signed
up.
Much fun was had. The game, however, was very limited, so I joined forces with
Tejo to work on a second version. We spent the past four months tweaking
the engine, adding new features and fixing my less-than-ideal code.
And yesterday, we completed the last
non-content-releated task, so today we met to discuss the actual content of the
game. The world, its inhabitants, quests, treasures and monsters.

We had an amazing time, ate lunch and brainstormed the weirdest
ideas.
<br><br>
He has a cute, tiny cat. She spent the afternoon with us, too.

<br><br><a href="https://lartu.net/images/A02N98.JPG"><img src ="https://lartu.net/images/c_A02N98.JPEG" title="A02N98" alt="Image: A02N98"></a><br><br>

At around 5 PM, the final sketches for the world were complete, so I
left Tejo's house. On the way back to my apartment, I heard somebody calling me.
<i>Could you lend us a hand?</i>, they said.
<br><br>
The calling voice was that of a mechanic from a car repair shop.
His associates and him needed help pushing a car up a ramp and into their workshop. I grouped
with them, along with an old-man that was also passing-by, and we got
the vehicle into their shop. Fun! While not something <i>that</i>
out of the ordinary, this was the kind of experience I was looking forward for.
For a moment, I met new people and did something I never do in my usual
routine. I regret not taking a picture with them for this article,
but I didn't want to be a nuisance. Next time I will.

<br><br><a href="https://lartu.net/images/L74E46.JPG"><img src ="https://lartu.net/images/c_L74E46.JPEG" title="L74E46" alt="Image: L74E46"></a><br><br>

The leaves on the street scattered by the storm from <a href="https://lartu.net/log_2021-05-22.html">the other day</a> were still there, although it seemed somebody had
been cleaning them up. Autumn.

<br><br>

When I got home, I fired up my computer and began turning the ideas we'd
discussed about into a reality. We are so close to the release, yet there's still
so much to do. I can barely wait.

<br><br><a href="https://lartu.net/images/M81A84.JPG"><img src ="https://lartu.net/images/c_M81A84.JPEG" title="M81A84" alt="Image: M81A84"></a><br><br>

Tomorrow we are going to a farmers' market and I'll meet my family for lunch afterwards,
with strict sanitary precautions. I hope after all of that I'll have something
new to write about.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<h1>2021-05-23: Walking around</h1>

Second day in a row I'm writting in this log. Don't get used to it,
but here's to keeping doing stuff now and then.
<br><br>
Today I had some free time, so I decided to go out and walk a little with
no destination in mind. I just chose a road and walked to see what I could
find. And find new things I did, which is always something good. Sadly, it
wasn't drizzling anymore. I like when it does.
<br><br>

My original idea was to go out and buy some take-away coffee. While at
home, I had cooked myself a plate of half-English mess, that's half a full
English breakfast, without the English part and half the dish, so I wasn't
feeling up for coffee anymore. I just went out for the walking part.

<br><br><a href="https://lartu.net/images/L29P12.JPG"><img src ="https://lartu.net/images/c_L29P12.JPEG" title="L29P12" alt="Image: L29P12"></a><br><br>

A few blocks away from home I stopped at a plant shop. I wanted to buy
a pot and some dirt for the leek I started growing
<a href="https://lartu.net/log_2021-05-22.html">yesterday</a>, but due to the lockdown you couldn't
go into the store, so I took note of their website to check their stock
later. They sell pretty pretty pots.

<br><br><a href="https://lartu.net/images/X97R90.JPG"><img src ="https://lartu.net/images/c_X97R90.JPEG" title="X97R90" alt="Image: X97R90"></a><br><br>

From there, I kept walking aimlessly. The streets were empty and quite
silent. I like that. Also they were covered by leaves from yesterday's rain.
I found an old storage building with a crane atop.
I had never seen it. I have not seen many things in my neighbourhood.
That's part of the reason I'm trying to go out more.

<br><br><a href="https://lartu.net/images/M02T44.JPG"><img src ="https://lartu.net/images/c_M02T44.JPEG" title="M02T44" alt="Image: M02T44"></a><br><br>

Then I found a bar that looked quite nice. Of course, I hadn't been
there before. When the people from the bar saw me taking photos of their
shop, a waiter came out and gave me a take-away menu of the place. Great
service. I may buy food there in the future.

<br><br><a href="https://lartu.net/images/C83I31.JPG"><img src ="https://lartu.net/images/c_C83I31.JPEG" title="C83I31" alt="Image: C83I31"></a><br><br>

They also had a very pretty, old-school round sign outside. I don't know
if I'd classify the place as a <i>bar</i> per s√©, but the sign said bar, so
that's the nomenclature I'm using.

<br><br><a href="https://lartu.net/images/I03E58.JPG"><img src ="https://lartu.net/images/c_I03E58.JPEG" title="I03E58" alt="Image: I03E58"></a><br><br>

After that, I kept wandering about. I passed by a drug store and bought some
antihistamines. If there's something I'm allergic to, it's every single
thing. And I was running out, so that was a nice stop. I also bought a
handheld electric massager. It was on sale and I like those things.
I haven't tried it yet, though.

<br><br><a href="https://lartu.net/images/V11W88.JPG"><img src ="https://lartu.net/images/c_V11W88.JPEG" title="V11W88" alt="Image: V11W88"></a><br><br>

Overall it was a very nice walk, I came back home refreshed and ready to
carry on studying. Tomorrow we meet with the Eterspire development team
to begin working on the content sprint. An afternoon spent world-building,
a dream come true! And hopefully, an interesting day to talk about.

			<description><![CDATA[<h1>2021-05-22: Pickles and Rain</h1>

Yesterday I read <a href="https://www.raptitude.com/2010/07/your-lifestyle-has-already-been-designed/"" target=_blank>this article</a>
about how our routines (working all day and having a little free time
during the evening) are functional to consumerism. It may be that way.
It may not, I don't really care much. What I do care about is that
<i>that's</i> my routine. Every day the same four walls, same activities,
same everything.
<br><br>
This is not the first time I've noticed this, though. I visited my
grandparents about two months ago after a long year of not seeing
them during the 2020 quarantine. I had a lot of stuff to tell them:
I had moved by myself, I was cooking a lot, I had started taking
classes in a new university, etc. Lots of changes and news.
<br><br>
Then, a month later, I visited them again. This time, I had nothing
new to tell.
<br><br>
The same goes for visiting my parents. I see them once a week or so.
When I moved by myself I had a lot of things to tell them. Then,
week after week, nothing. I cooked some stuff, I went to the same
old shops, work, sleep, study. Eternal while true. I struggled trying
to find something to talk about. What's next?
I could do a lot more, why am I not doing so?
<br><br>
Well, I believe the main impediment right now is the COVID-19
pandemic. We've been quarantined. Again. And traveling abroad is not
particularly easy at this very moment. I live in a big city,
though. There <i>should</i> be things to do around here! Why am I not
partaking in that? Then again, the answer is the pandemic.
<br><br>
In any case, though, there are other things I should be able to do
to break the monotony. So I've started this log. I will try to do
something new now and then. And who knows, maybe I'll be able to
escape the oppressive cycle my life has turned into.
<br><br>
So, <b>what did I do today?</b>

<br><br><a href="https://lartu.net/images/M72J76.JPG"><img src ="https://lartu.net/images/c_M72J76.JPEG" title="M72J76" alt="Image: M72J76"></a><br><br>

Today it rained a lot. There's
a cyclone alert and everything. 
Sadly, I didn't take any pictures.
I didn't know I was going to write a log of my day.
In any case, given that we are to be
quarantined -and thanks to the weather- the streets were rather
empty. We went to the grocery store taking the longest possible
route, seizing the opportunity to discover our neighbourhood. I love
the way everything shines when it rains.
<br><br>
We even found some dumbells somebody had discarded on the street,
so we took them home. They were in perfect shape!
<br><br>
We came back home wet and cold after buying some veggies. I
cooked some soup and baked pumpkin, and we ate it
outside in the patio, under the rain-turned-drizzle. Cool
experience.

<br><br><a href="https://lartu.net/images/I03C35.JPG"><img src ="https://lartu.net/images/c_I03C35.JPEG" title="I03C35" alt="Image: I03C35"></a><br><br>

Having eaten and all, I pickled some onions and peppers and
left them in a cupboard to marinate. In a week or two they'll
be ready to eat.

<br><br><a href="https://lartu.net/images/Y43C23.JPG"><img src ="https://lartu.net/images/c_Y43C23.JPEG" title="Y43C23" alt="Image: Y43C23"></a><br><br>

I'm growing a leek. The rest of it went into the soup. Once it grows
new roots I'll plant it in a pot.

<br><br>

Also, I started reading <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i>, by J. D. Salinger.
My uncle had recommended it to me many times. He had even lent me his
copy at some point. I hadn't had the chance to read it, though.
I'm walfway through. Great book, the
way it's written reminds me a lot of how 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_in_the_Woods"" target=_blank>Night in the Woods</a>
is written. That's never a bad thing.

<br><br>

Tomorrow I will try to go out and walk a little more. I can't go
out for <i>too long</i> because we've been requested to stay at home,
but somewhere close should be fine. Maybe to a park or to get some
take-away coffee.]]></description>
