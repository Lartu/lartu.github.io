<h1>2021-05-22: Pickles and Rain</h1>

<p>Yesterday I read <a href="https://www.raptitude.com/2010/07/your-lifestyle-has-already-been-designed/" class=external target=_blank>this article</a> about how our routines (working all day and having a little free time during the evening) are functional to consumerism. It may be that way. It may not, I don't really care much. What I do care about is that <i>that's</i> my routine. Every day the same four walls, same activities, same everything.</p>

<p>This is not the first time I've noticed this, though. I visited my grandparents about two months ago after a long year of not seeing them during the 2020 quarantine. I had a lot of stuff to tell them: I had moved by myself, I was cooking a lot, I had started taking classes in a new university, etc. Lots of changes and news.</p>

<p>Then, a month later, I visited them again. This time, I had nothing new to tell.</p>

<p>The same goes for visiting my parents. I see them once a week or so. When I moved by myself I had a lot of things to tell them. Then, week after week, nothing. I cooked some stuff, I went to the same old shops, work, sleep, study. Eternal while true. I struggled trying to find something to talk about. What's next? I could do a lot more, why am I not doing so?</p>

<p>Well, I believe the main impediment right now is the COVID-19 pandemic. We've been quarantined. Again. And traveling abroad is not particularly easy at this very moment. I live in a big city, though. There <i>should</i> be things to do around here! Why am I not partaking in that? Then again, the answer is the pandemic.</p>

<p>In any case, though, there are other things I should be able to do to break the monotony. So I've started this log. I will try to do something new now and then. And who knows, maybe I'll be able to escape the oppressive cycle my life has turned into.</p>

<p>So, <b>what did I do today?</b></p>

<p>Today it rained a lot. There's a cyclone alert and everything. Sadly, I didn't take any pictures. I didn't know I was going to write a log of my day. In any case, given that we are to be quarantined -and thanks to the weather- the streets were rather empty. We went to the grocery store taking the longest possible route, seizing the opportunity to discover our neighbourhood. I love the way everything shines when it rains.</p>

<p>We even found some dumbells somebody had discarded on the street, so we took them home. They were in perfect shape!</p>

<p>We came back home wet and cold after buying some veggies. I cooked some soup and baked pumpkin, and we ate it outside in the patio, under the rain-turned-drizzle. Cool experience.</p>

<p>Having eaten and all, I pickled some onions and peppers and left them in a cupboard to marinate. In a week or two they'll be ready to eat.</p>

<p>I'm growing a leek. The rest of it went into the soup. Once it grows new roots I'll plant it in a pot.</p>

<p>Also, I started reading <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i>, by J. D. Salinger. My uncle had recommended it to me many times. He had even lent me his copy at some point. I hadn't had the chance to read it, though. I'm walfway through. Great book, the way it's written reminds me a lot of how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_in_the_Woods" class=external target=_blank>Night in the Woods</a> is written. That's never a bad thing.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I will try to go out and walk a little more. I can't go out for <i>too long</i> because we've been requested to stay at home, but somewhere close should be fine. Maybe to a park or to get some take-away coffee.</p>
