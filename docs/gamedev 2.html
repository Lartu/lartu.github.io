<h1>Videogames</h1>

<p>I've long held a passion for game development. Back in the day I released many Flash games and, with the advent of Android and iOS devices, I've also made my way into the Play Store and the App Store. Lately, I've been also working on browser-based and downloadable games for PC.</p>

<p>My games can also be found on <a href="https://lartu.itch.io" class=external target=_blank>my itch.io page</a>.</p>

<h2>Eterspire (Browser-based, 2021)</h2>

<p><img class="midimg" src="images/c_M14D67.png" title="M14D67" alt="Image: M14D67"><small>— M14D67 - <a href="images/M14D67.png"  target=_blank>view original</a> (1031 KiB, PNG)</small></p>

<p><a href="https://eterspire.com" class=external target=_blank>Eterspire</a> is a Browser-Based, Free Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game. You take on the role of an adventurer in the land of Eterspire, fight creatures, find treasure and make friends with other players!</p>

<p>I've always wanted to make an MMORPG and this is it. It's not a hardcore MMORPG by any means, it's more casual than anything, but people keep logging in and playing and they seem to really like it. The game is frequently updated with new content.</p>

<h2>Soft Drizzle: B-Track (MacOS & Windows, 2020)</h2>

<p><img class="midimg" src="images/c_F96R58.png" title="F96R58" alt="Image: F96R58"><small>— F96R58 - <a href="images/F96R58.png"  target=_blank>view original</a> (771 KiB, PNG)</small></p>

<p><a href="https://lartu.itch.io/soft-drizzle-b-track" class=external target=_blank>Soft Drizzle: B-Track</a> is a short (30 - 50 min. long) visual novel about friendship and Halloween Festivals. It even includes an escape room! It was written in Unity over the course of a month as my submission for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/spooktober-visual-novel-jam-by-devtalk2" class=external target=_blank>Spooktober Visual Novel Jam</a>. It's a sequel to Soft Drizzle, a visual novel I released a month earlier. Graphics are bigger and better and it even includes 3D scenes to interact with and explore.</p>

<h2>Soft Drizzle (Browser-based, 2020)</h2>

<p><img class="midimg" src="images/c_U61R90.png" title="U61R90" alt="Image: U61R90"><small>— U61R90 - <a href="images/U61R90.png"  target=_blank>view original</a> (279 KiB, PNG)</small></p>

<p><a href="https://lartu.itch.io/soft-drizzle" class=external target=_blank>Soft Drizzle</a> is a short (15 - 25 min. long) visual novel about friendship and rainy days. It was written in JavaScript and <a href="https://p5js.org" class=external target=_blank>p5.js</a> over the course of seven days as my submission <a href="https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam-2020" class=external target=_blank>2020's LOWREZJAM</a>. As such, it's resultion is 64x64, so I'd hardly believe you've played a smaller visual novel before! People really, really liked it and I'm very happy with the cute, wholesome result.</p>

<h2>Fateful Lore (Android & iOS, 2020)</h2>

<p><img class="midimg" src="images/c_L35S56.png" title="L35S56" alt="Image: L35S56"><small>— L35S56 - <a href="images/L35S56.png"  target=_blank>view original</a> (282 KiB, PNG)</small></p>

<p><a href="https://fantaseel.itch.io/fateful-lore" class=external target=_blank>Fateful Lore</a> is an all-new retro-style role-playing game by <a href="https://fantaseel.com/" class=external target=_blank>Fantaseel Interactive</a>, a start-up I set up with some colleages to develop video-games. Inspired by old-school, 8-bit JRPGs, Fateful Lore is a nostalgic adventure that will delight fans of the genre! It's inspired by classic RPGs like Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy. We found that there were no RPGs on these platforms that looked and played like the games we loved when we were young, so we decided to make one ourselves.</p>

<h2>Eternal Lux (Android, 2014)</h2>

<p><img class="midimg" src="images/c_W91T50.png" title="W91T50" alt="Image: W91T50"><small>— W91T50 - <a href="images/W91T50.png"  target=_blank>view original</a> (361 KiB, PNG)</small></p>

<p><a href="https://lartu.itch.io/eternal-lux" class=external target=_blank>Eternal Lux</a> is an old-school styled Android RPG, designed to look like a game from the 80's for the Apple II or MS-DOS like Ultima, with 16-color graphics and an awesome MIDI soundtrack. It's written completely in Java-Processing without a single class, for at the moment I did not know a thing about object oriented programming. Nevertheless, Eternal Lux was downloaded by over 20.000 people from all over the world and has received fairly positive reviews from an assortment of gaming websites and users alike, holding a total score of 4.3 / 5 on the Google Play Store. It's free and weighs less than 800kb, so go give it a try!</p>

<h2>Aidinia: An Epic Adventure! (Android, 2013)</h2>

<p><img class="midimg" src="images/c_B49L04.png" title="B49L04" alt="Image: B49L04"><small>— B49L04 - <a href="images/B49L04.png"  target=_blank>view original</a> (341 KiB, PNG)</small></p>

<p><a href="https://lartu.itch.io/aidinia" class=external target=_blank>Aidinia - An Epic Adventure</a> was my first attempt at developing an Android RPG. It's an 8-bit-like role-playing game written in Basic4Android and, being my first project on the system, the controls are a little clunky. It also may or may not work well on newer Android phones. Reviews were positive though and it holds a score of 4,1 / 5 stars. This was really painful to develop and it took me a very long time, so I am quite happy with how the game turned out in the end, even if it's not the best example of good game design choices. It was a paid title for a long time, but due to a disagreement with the policies Google enforces on their store I've decided to release it for free.</p>

<h2>Other Games</h2>
<p>I have also made other games that are not worth mentioning or that have been sadly lost to time.</p>
