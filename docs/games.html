        focused on streamlining the gameplay experience and making it more welcoming to
        new players. It introduces a main storyline and multiple quality of life features
        that make the game much better.</p><h3><a href="https://www.eterspire.com" target=_blank>Eterspire</a> <small>(iOS & Android, 2023)</small></h3><a href="https://www.eterspire.com" target=_blank><img src="images/eterspire3.png" /></a><p>A complete, graphically superior rewrite of Eterspire, focused on questing,
        befriending wacky characters, exploring, and upgrading your gear.
        We felt the game was now more suited for mobile devices, so we took the leap.
        Dubbed <i>"the best mobile MMORPG in the history of the universe"</i> <small>(by ourselves)</small>.</p><h3><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211223154610/https://eterspire.com/" target=_blank>Eterspire: Return of Salgaraak</a> <small>(Web & Windows, 2022-2023)</small></h3><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211223154610/https://eterspire.com/" target=_blank><img src="images/eterspire2.png" /></a><p><small>No longer playable, linked to archived version on the Wayback Machine.</small></p><p>Known initially as Eterspire - Beta II, it was a complete overhaul of Eterspire,
        focused on exploring a world and completing quests. It started as a hobby project with
        a friend before eventually becoming our full-time job. Offline since the release of
        Eterspire (2023).</p><h3><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210416113913/https://www.eterspire.com/" target=_blank>Eterspire</a> <small>(Web, 2021)</small></h3><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210416113913/https://www.eterspire.com/" target=_blank><img src="images/eterspire1.png" /></a><p><small>No longer playable, linked to archived version on the Wayback Machine.</small></p><p>A minimal MMORPG about exploring an infinite tower, fighting monsters, finding
        equipment, and climbing higher than everyone else. Made over the course of four months.
        Eventually replaced by Eterspire: Return of Salgaraak.
        Lovingly nicknamed 'Eterspire: Beta I'.</p><h3><a href="https://lartu.itch.io/soft-drizzle-b-track" target=_blank>Soft Drizzle: B-Track</a> <small>(Windows & macOS, 2020)</small></h3><a href="https://lartu.itch.io/soft-drizzle-b-track" target=_blank><img src="images/softdrizzle2.png" /></a><p>A short visual novel about friendship and Halloween Festivals.

        7 days for LOWREZJAM 2020. Full of typos, as the screenplay was written during a long,
        coffee fueled night writing session. I'd love to remake it someday.</p><h3><a href="https://www.fatefullore.com/" target=_blank>Fateful Lore</a> <small>(Android & iOS, 2020)</small></h3><a href="https://www.fatefullore.com/" target=_blank><img src="images/fatefullore.png" /></a><p>Critically acclaimed retro-inspired RPG for Android and iOS devices. We found
        no RPGs on these platforms that looked and played the way we wanted, so we made one.</p><h3><a href="https://lartu.itch.io/eternal-lux" target=_blank>Eternal Lux</a> <small>(Android, 2014)</small></h3><a href="https://lartu.itch.io/eternal-lux" target=_blank><img src="images/eternallux.png" /></a><p><small>No longer available on the Google Play store.</small></p><p>A mobile SRPG for Android Devices inspired by the Ultima games.
