<h1>Notes on Everything</h1>

<h2>project development</h2>

<ul>
<li> Work on projects you'll still want to work on tomorrow. <li> Break your projects down into as many tiny tasks as possible. <li> Remove as much content from your project as possible. Keep only what's essential. <li> Focus on your current project. <li> Work on your project at least a tiny bit every single day. <li> Post about your project on social media whenever possible to gather feedback and build a following.</li>
</ul>

<p><small>These previous points are part of the <a href="lartips.html" >Lartips</a>.</small></p>

<ul>
<li> Finish a project before you optimize it. A released project is better than a well-polished one that no-one will ever see. <li> Most software out there is messy. That's why it's out there. <li> Aesthetics is important. <li> Design for the future. You will be there and have to deal with your current code.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Rule of Modularity: Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces. <li>Rule of Composition: Design programs to be connected to other programs. <li>Rule of Parsimony: Write a big program only when it is clear by demonstration that nothing else will do.</li>
</ul>

<p><small>(<i>The Art of Unix Programming</i>, by Eric S. Raymond)</small></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://brandur.org/small-sharp-tools" class=external target=_blank>A tool can be <i>too large</i> or <i>to small</i></a>. The boundaries of any service should be considered in depth, and if built to be small, it should be for more reason than virtue of size alone. <li>Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.</li>
</ul>

<h2>health</h2>

<ul>
<li> If you feel like everyone hates you, you need to sleep. <li> If you feel like you have everyone else, you need to eat. <li> If you are pulling an all-nighter, keep a bottle of water by your side. It's very easy to forget to drink water while working late.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Work</h2>

<p>These points have been taken from <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/knowledge.html" class=external target=_blank>XXIIVV's Knowledge Portal</a>.</p>

<p><b>Work Knowledge</b></p>

<ul>
<li> Find your passion and figure out how to get paid for it. <li> Do whatever you want to do, but be the best at it. <li> Strive for simplicity and competence, but embrace the messiness along the way. <li> Under-promise and over-deliver, and own up to your screw-ups. <li> Doing what everybody else is doing feels like the safest thing to do, making it the most competitive, and thus the riskiest. <li> No one is on their deathbed is wishing they spent more time at work. <li> Never stop learning.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Work Habits</b></p>

<ul>
<li> Doing the right tasks is more important than doing your tasks efficiently. <li> Write down your goals. Break them down into manageable tasks. <li> Tackle one task at a time, and group similar tasks together. <li> Drink plenty of water. <li> Keep a record of your time use.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Work Charisma</b></p>

<ul>
<li> Always look a person in the eye when you talk to them. <li> Always stand up to shake someone's hand. <li> Be conscious of your body language. <li> Ask more than you answer. <li> First impressions matter. <li> When you walk, look straight ahead, not at your feet. <li> Never hit anyone unless they are an immediate threat. <li> No matter their job or status, everyone deserves your respect.</li>
</ul>

<h2>food & ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li> Moisture accelerates rot. <li> Potatoes and onions will last for months if kept in a dark dry place.</li>
</ul>
