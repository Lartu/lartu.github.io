For some time I had a lot of trouble struggling to finish my own projects,
most of them indie games. After tons and tons of abandoned ideas, I ended up
creating this list of tips that actually helped me finish stuff, based on
my own experience and introspection on why I wasn't being able to complete
my developments.

<h2>Be Passionate About It</h2>

This may sound really dumb, but if you are not passionate about the idea you
are trying to develop, you are going to end up discarding it in the future
when something shinier comes along. When you have an idea you'd like to work
on, give it some thought. Do I really want to do this? Will I still want to
work on this tomorrow? Next week? Next month? Have I been thinking about this
for some time now?

<div class="split"></div>

The idea behind this is not to tell you not to work on things just out of
impulse, but to consider that projects you won't care about tomorrow will not
probably come to fruition. Of course, there's nothing wrong with experimentation
for the sake of it.

<h2>separate tasks</h2>

This is very, very important! Rome wasn't built in a day, and a long trip starts
with the first step. You should make a list of all the things you need to do
in order to complete your project. 
<a href="https://doarchstairs2016.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/arch-251-cortazar-instructions-on-how-to-climb-a-staircase.pdf" class="external" target=_blank>Cortazar's Instructions of How to Climb a Staircase</a>
are a great example of how to separate a bigger problem in smaller tasks.
Try to keep them as granular as possible. If you can, use Trello or another
tool (maybe even post-its) to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board" class="external" target=_blank>kanban board</a>
to keep track of what you have done, what you are doing and what you need to do next.
<div class="split"></div>
If you need help setting up a kanban board, I'd recommend keeping it simple
with four columns: <b>to-do</b>, <b>doing</b>, <b>done</b> and <b>won't do</b>.
We'll come back to this last one later.

<h2>trim the fat</h2>

Your project normally has a lot of unnecessary content. When we plan a new idea,
we usually tend to add a lot of features we'd like it to have, but that aren't
a requirement for the finished project. Discard them or leave them for future
updates once the project has been released. Work towards the minimum viable
product (MVP) you can ship.
<div class="split"></div>
Having separated your project in small tasks is amazing for trimming the fat:
give all your to-be-done tickets a look and move all the ones that aren't
<i>really</i> necessary to the <b>won't do</b> column. The less you have to do,
the better. Finishing a small project is already hard enough.

<h2>focus on your current project</h2>

Developing stuff takes a lot of time. If you are already working on something,
do not spend time working on other potential prototype ideas! Some people like
to start side projects for when they are tired of their main project. This
might be okay for them, but what I've mostly seen is that when people do this
they end up not finishing any of the projects they have started. Focus!
If you need free time, go take a walk, watch a movie, play a game. Whatever 
you like, but when you are working on some project, let it be the main
project you've been meaning to complete.

<h2>Never have a 0 day</h2>

This means to work a tiny bit on your project every single day. At least.
If you are writing a book and you add a single sentence every single day,
at the end of the day you'll have one sentence more than you had before.
This is good, it's progress. But more often than not, you'll end up getting
worked up and adding much more than one single sentence. This is even better,
it's more progress.
<div class="split"></div>
My grandmother had a saying that went something like <i>"eating and
scratching, it's all starting"</i>
<sup>1</sup>,
which could be translated more idiomatically
as 'once you pop you can't stop', referring to the fact that once 
you start scratching yourself or eating it's
difficult to stop. In some way, the same also applies here.

<h2>Social Media</h2>

This last point is a little more vain, but it's useful nonetheless. If you
use social media, you can upload footage of your game during development
to build a following that may adquire / use / check your project once it's finished
and released.
I will also keep you motivated and you'll gather useful feedback. You'll probably feel less
inclined to abandon your work if there's a group of people telling you how cool 
your last update looks.
