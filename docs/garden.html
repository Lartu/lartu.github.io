<h1>Digital Gardens</h1>

<div class="bigimg"><img src ="images/c_P44N10.jpg" title="P44N10" alt="Image: P44N10"><small>— P44N10  (JPEG) - <a href="images/P44N10.jpg" target=_blank>view original</a> (639 KiB, JPG)</small></div>

<a href="https://fdisk.space/designphilosophy/#digital-garden" class="external" target=_blank>Fred Bednarski</a>
explains this much better than I. The contents of this page are strongly 
based on theirs.
<div class="split"></div>
The lartunet rejects the conventional trends and practices of
the <a href="https://fdisk.space/mainstreamweb/" class="external" target=_blank>mainstream web</a>,
that is broken, sluggish, bloated and full of corporate
intervention. It instead focuses on providing an honest
experience that encourages exploration.
<div class="split"></div>
As such, I aim to make every page of the lartunet straightforward,
free of bloat and distractions. I want this website to be
accessible from any internet-capable device, regardless of
age and computing power.
<div class="split"></div>
I also don't shoot for perfection, but maintainability and
scalability. I've developed my own HTML pre-processor to help
me write and expand the lartunet, while keeping it minimal
and simple.
<div class="split"></div>
This all takes me to the subject of digital gardens.
The lartunet is my digital garden.
As Fred states on fdisk:
<div class="split"></div>
<i>«The digital garden movement
focuses on a more mindful and personal approach to
organizing and presenting information on the web.
<div class="split"></div>
[...]
Gardens grow things. You are the one cultivating the
garden, but in the end nature will take whatever course
it wants and you'll adapt. Just like real gardens, a
digital garden is a constant work in progress; it's a
different way of thinking about creating. Instead of
focusing on a finished "product" you embrace the process.
Create a page for anything you want to preserve, write
what's on your mind. Don't worry about finishing it
there and there - it's not a draft, it's a new
seedling, worthy of its place in the sun. Expand it
when you have more to add, let it spark new ideas and
new pages. Give it time and space to grow.
<div class="split"></div>
Gardens are physical spaces that are both familiar and
wild. You can stick to the path and get where you want to
be, or you can go exploring and even get lost inside.
A good garden will provide a sense of discovery.
A digital garden should mimic such topology. You need
just enough structure to allow for easy navigation,
everything beyond that should be designed with
exploration in mind. Use in-text hyperlinks as paths.
Connect ideas and topics. Let pages branch out to new
pages and even loop back on themselves. Give options
to step off the beaten path, but don't force it.»</i>
