<h1>2021-05-23: Walking around</h1>

<p>Second day in a row I'm writting in this log. Don't get used to it, but here's to keeping doing stuff now and then.</p>

<p>Today I had some free time, so I decided to go out and walk a little with no destination in mind. I just chose a road and walked to see what I could find. And find new things I did, which is always something good. Sadly, it wasn't drizzling anymore. I like when it does.</p>

<p>My original idea was to go out and buy some take-away coffee. While at home, I had cooked myself a plate of half-English mess, that's half a full English breakfast, without the English part and half the dish, so I wasn't feeling up for coffee anymore. I just went out for the walking part.</p>

<p>A few blocks away from home I stopped at a plant shop. I wanted to buy a pot and some dirt for the leek I started growing <a href="log_2021-05-22.html" >yesterday</a>, but due to the lockdown you couldn't go into the store, so I took note of their website to check their stock later. They sell pretty pretty pots.</p>

<p>From there, I kept walking aimlessly. The streets were empty and quite silent. I like that. Also they were covered by leaves from yesterday's rain. I found an old storage building with a crane atop. I had never seen it. I have not seen many things in my neighbourhood. That's part of the reason I'm trying to go out more.</p>

<p><img  src="images/c_M02T44.gif" title="M02T44" alt="Image: M02T44"><small>— M02T44 (b&w version) (quantized 16C) - <a href="images/M02T44.JPG"  target=_blank>view original</a> (2123 KiB, JPG)</small></p>

<p>Then I found a bar that looked quite nice. Of course, I hadn't been there before. When the people from the bar saw me taking photos of their shop, a waiter came out and gave me a take-away menu of the place. Great service. I may buy food there in the future.</p>

<p><img  src="images/c_C83I31.gif" title="C83I31" alt="Image: C83I31"><small>— C83I31 (b&w version) (quantized 16C) - <a href="images/C83I31.JPG"  target=_blank>view original</a> (2743 KiB, JPG)</small></p>

<p>They also had a very pretty, old-school round sign outside. I don't know if I'd classify the place as a <i>bar</i> per sé, but the sign said bar, so that's the nomenclature I'm using.</p>

<p><img  src="images/c_I03E58.gif" title="I03E58" alt="Image: I03E58"><small>— I03E58 (b&w version) (quantized 16C) - <a href="images/I03E58.JPG"  target=_blank>view original</a> (1130 KiB, JPG)</small></p>

<p>After that, I kept wandering about. I passed by a drug store and bought some antihistamines. If there's something I'm allergic to, it's every single thing. And I was running out, so that was a nice stop. I also bought a handheld electric massager. It was on sale and I like those things. I haven't tried it yet, though.</p>

<p>Overall it was a very nice walk, I came back home refreshed and ready to carry on studying. Tomorrow we meet with the Eterspire development team to begin working on the content sprint. An afternoon spent world-building, a dream come true! And hopefully, an interesting day to talk about.</p>
