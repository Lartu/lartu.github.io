<hr><h1 id='games'>Videogames</h1><a href="index.html"><img src="images/arcade.png" /></a><p>This section talks abouts the videogames I've developed. Most of them can also be found on my <a href="https://lartu.itch.io" target=_blank>Itch.io</a> page.</p><ul><li><b><a href="https://www.eterspire.com">Eterspire (Journey Anew!)</a></b><br><i>iOS & Android, 2024</i><br>Award Winning MMORPG with over 100K players. A rework of most content from Eterspire (2023),
            focused on streamlining the gameplay experience and making it more welcoming to
            new players. It introduces a main storyline and multiple quality of life features
            that make the game much better.</li><li><b><a href="https://www.eterspire.com">Eterspire (Mobile, Alpha 3)</a></b><br><i>iOS & Android, 2023</i><br>A complete, graphically superior rewrite of Eterspire, focused on questing,
            befriending wacky characters, exploring, and upgrading your gear.
            We felt the game was now more suited for mobile devices, so we took the leap.
            Dubbed <i>"the best mobile MMORPG in the history of the universe"</i> by ourselves.</li><li><b><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211223154610/https://eterspire.com/">Eterspire: Return of Salgaraak (Beta II)</a></b><br><i>Web & Windows, 2022-2023</i><br><small>No longer playable, linked to archived version on the Wayback Machine.</small><br>Known initially as Eterspire - Beta II, it was a complete overhaul of Eterspire,
            focused on exploring a world and completing quests. It started as a hobby project with
            a friend before eventually becoming our full-time job. Offline since the release of
            Eterspire (2023).</li><li><b><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210416113913/https://www.eterspire.com/">Eterspire (Beta I)</a></b><br><i>Web, 2021</i><br><small>No longer playable, linked to archived version on the Wayback Machine.</small><br>A minimal MMORPG about exploring an infinite tower, fighting monsters, finding
            equipment, and climbing higher than everyone else. Made over the course of four months.
            Eventually replaced by Eterspire: Return of Salgaraak.
            Lovingly nicknamed 'Eterspire: Beta I'.</li><li><b><a href="https://lartu.itch.io/soft-drizzle-b-track">Soft Drizzle: B-Track</a></b><br><i>Windows & macOS, 2020</i><br>A short visual novel about friendship and Halloween Festivals. Sequel to Soft Drizzle.
            Made in a month for the Spooktober Visual Novel Jam. Awarded Best Unity Submission.</li><li><b><a href="https://lartu.itch.io/soft-drizzle">Soft Drizzle</a></b><br><i>Web, 2020</i><br>A short, 64x64 resolution visual novel about friendship and rainy days, made in
            7 days for LOWREZJAM 2020. Full of typos, as the screenplay was written during a long,
            coffee fueled night writing session. I'd love to remake it someday.</li><li><b><a href="https://www.fatefullore.com/">Fateful Lore</a></b><br><i>Android & iOS, 2020</i><br>Critically acclaimed retro-inspired RPG for Android and iOS devices. We found
            no RPGs on these platforms that looked and played the way we wanted, so we made one.
            The company that published League of Legends in Korea almost published it over there,
            but then the pandemic struck.</li><li><b><a href="https://lartu.itch.io/eternal-lux">Eternal Lux</a></b><br><i>Android, 2014</i><br><small>No longer available on the Google Play store.</small><br>A mobile SRPG for Android Devices inspired by the Ultima games.
            Designed to be as lightweight as possible. Downloaded by tens of thousands of
            players worldwide.</li><li><b><a href="https://lartu.itch.io/aidinia">Aidinia: An Epic Adventure!</a></b><br><i>Android, 2013</i><br><small>No longer available on the Google Play store.</small><br>A mobile RPG for Android Devices inspired by Gameboy Color RPGs
            such as Dragon Quest I & II. Although it's not the first game I
            ever released, it's the first 'serious' one.</li><li>Dozens of Flash games, some of which have won awards on Newgrounds.</li></ul>
<hr><h1 id='langs'>Programming Languages & Esolangs</h1><a href="index.html"><img src="images/dinosaurs.png" /></a><p>This section talks abouts the programming languages I've developed (to varying degrees of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language" target=_blank>esotericism</a>).</p><ul><li><b><a href="https://www.ldpl-lang.org">LDPL</a></b><br><i>2019</i><br>Lartu's Definitive Programming Language, or LDPL the Dinosaur Programming Language. A COBOL-inspired programming language, designed to be expressive, readable,
            fast and easy to learn. In other words: a masterpiece.
            Considered complete and in minimal evolution mode since
            LDPL 5. One of the best things I've ever made, for a number of reasons.</li><li><b><a href="https://github.com/Lartu/Katalyn/">Katalyn</a></b><br><i>2024</i><br>The Katalyn programming language is a powerful scripting language designed to
            pair the simplicity of Lua with the power of Perl. It integrates an intuitive syntax
            with a comprehensive, batteries-included standard library of useful functions.
            Whether you are writing console scripts, calling APIs or parsing text, Katalyn
            helps you get things done without getting in the way!</li><li><b><a href="https://github.com/Lartu/polaris">Polaris</a></b><br><i>2020</i><br>A minimal, experimental stack-based, concatenative, interpreted programming
            language with strings as its only data type. Written in C++98, designed to run on
            Unix systems, backported to MS-DOS.</li><li><b><a href="https://github.com/Lartu/WebSCFL">WebSCFL</a></b><br><i>2024</i><br>WebSCFL stands for Web Sectioned Command First Language.
            It's a programming language designed to make simple Prof. Dr. Style websites.
            This website used to be written and compiled using WebSCFL.</li><li><b><a href="https://github.com/Lartu/Polaris-Twist">Polaris Twist</a></b><br><i>2024</i><br>Polaris Twist is a refreshing stack-based, concatenative,
            interpreted programming language with strings as its only data type.
            It's a revision of my original Polaris, much faster and with Foreign
            Function Interface support. It has been designed to be small in size
            and minimal in language features. Written in C++98, so it can probably
            be compiled with any C++ compiler out there.</li><li><b><a href="https://github.com/Lartu/nari2023">Nari (2023)</a></b><br><i>2023</i><br>Nari (2023) is a new iteration of my Nari programming language.
            I develop it to relax, so I call Nari 'programming language programming as therapy'.
            Nari is inspired by Forth, or how I imagine Forth to be, as I've never written a
            single line of Forth. Nari is a weakly typed language. Its only data types are
            strings and integers. I don't know if it's fast or not (it probably isn't).
            I might expand it over time. I also might not.</li></ul>
<hr><h1 id='projects'>Other Computer Projects</h1><a href="index.html"><img src="images/computer.png" /></a><p>This section highlights some of my projects, though I've developed many others that aren't included,
    either because they don't fit here or because I don't find them significant enough to add. Oh bother.</p><ul><li><b><a href="https://github.com/Lartu/p5.clickable">p5.clickable</a></b><br><i>2019</i><br>Event driven, easy-to-use button library for P5.js. It even ended up in a P5 book. I'm in a book!</li><li><b><a href="files/larturead.html">Larturead</a></b><br><i>2024</i><br>Web reimplementation of BeKnowledge, my reading tool for reading fast.</li><li><b><a href="https://github.com/Lartu/dir">dir</a></b><br><i>2024</i><br>This is a tiny script I use to display the contents of a directory in my terminal in a fashion similar to MS-DOS's dir, which I like better than the usual ls.</li><li><b><a href="https://github.com/Lartu/GBA-Dev">GBA-Dev</a></b><br><i>2023</i><br>Some tests and a half-baked (but very performant) pixel graphical library for Gameboy Advance game development.</li><li><b><a href="https://github.com/Lartu/TunaBB">TunaBB</a></b><br><i>2023</i><br>A bulletin board designed from scratch to be self-contained, easy to deploy, easy to customize and easy to extend.</li><li><b><a href="https://github.com/Lartu/mitsubachi">Mitsubachi</a></b><br><i>2019</i><br>Mitsubachi is a tiny and open chat protocol, designed to be minimal, easy to implement, easy to use and easy to understand. Mitsubachi supports nicknames, nickname changing, user-to-user messaging and channel / group (known in Mitsubachi as 'distribution lists') chat.</li><li><b><a href="https://github.com/Lartu/tmon">tmon</a></b><br><i>2020</i><br>tmon, the [You]Tube Monitor, is a tool to make regular, local backups of your YouTube music playlists. It's pronounced te-mon, with te like in tetris and mon like in monitor.</li><li><b><a href="https://github.com/Lartu/OpenNapkin">OpenNapkin</a></b><br><i>2020</i><br>OpenNapkin is a graphical Gopher client written in Gambas3. I wrote OpenNapkin because I wasn't able to find another Gopher client that wasn't written only for console or that wasn't part of a much bigger web-browsing suite.</li><li>I'm most probably forgetting something.</li></ul>
<hr><h1 id='books'>Curated Reads</h1><a href="index.html"><img src="images/books.png" /></a><p>Also known as 'Books I Really Like'.</p><ul><li><b>World of Warcraft</b><br><i>Daniel Lisi, 2016, Boss Fight Books</i><br>With over 100 million accounts and $10 billion in revenue, World of Warcraft is the most-subscribed MMORPG and highest-grossing game ever. Daniel Lisi, a lifelong WoW player turned game developer, explores its origins, addictive gameplay, social impact, and the deep connections forged within its world.</li><li><b>EverQuest</b><br><i>Matthew S. Smith, 2024, Boss Fight Books</i><br>«You're in our world now.» Sony's 1999 ad for EverQuest invited players into a groundbreaking MMORPG. It became the top subscription game in North America for five years until World of Warcraft took over. Journalist Matthew S. Smith explores its creation, impact on gaming addiction, and lasting legacy.</li><li><b>.hack//AI Buster</b><br><i>Tatsuya Hamazaki, 2002. My edition is by Tokyopop, published in 2006.</i><br>AI Buster, the prequel to .hack follows the avatar Albireo, as he tries to discover why The World -- the most advanced game ever created is in danger of falling apart. I haven't played the hack games as of this writing, but this book is an amazing MMORPG read regardless. Also my favourite book.</li></ul>

<hr><h1 id='links'>List of Cool Links</h1><a href="index.html"><img src="images/links.png" /></a><h2>What and Why</h2><p>Google and Bing have become very crappy. Every day I find it harder and harder to find stuff there. Some time ago I wrote a tweet stating that <i>'I used to be a
    Google user, now it doesn't find anything. I moved to Bing a month ago, it's now become
    the same. It's all AI nonsense. It's time to go back to 'Cool Sites' links on personal
    webpages. We've gone full circle.'</i></p><p>This is my (self) response to that.</p><p>(BTW I use <a href="https://www.ecosia.org" target=_blank>Ecosia</a> now, and it seems
    to work much better than the alternatives. It's a keyword based search engine, so it
    doesn't search by matching your query to website profiles; it actually tries to match
    the words you requested.)</p><p>I've recently learned about Awesome Lists*. I don't think this qualifies as one.
    But here's some stuff I found interesting. I'm mostly into game design and development
    (particularly MMORPGs), so I expect to end up adding a lot of resources about that here.
    And other things. I hope you find it interesing too!</p><p><small>*Awesome Lists are curated lists of resources about a specific topic. These
