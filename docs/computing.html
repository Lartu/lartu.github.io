<h1>computing</h1>

<div class="bigimg"><img src ="images/c_D72V80.jpg" title="D72V80" alt="Image: D72V80"><small>— D72V80  (JPEG) - <a href="images/D72V80.jpg" target=_blank>view original</a> (509 KiB, JPG)</small></div>

<h1>philosophy</h1>

I separate <a href="gamedev.html">videogames</a> from general software as a matter
of principle.
<div class="split"></div>
I tend to develop software that works on old software and unsupported
operating systems as well as modern computing platforms. Older computers
are incredible pieces of engineering that are still very powerful.
Software nowadays is too bloated and energy hungry.
Planned obsolescence <a href="https://thedorkweb.substack.com/p/tales-from-the-dork-web-3" class="external" target=_blank>is a thing</a>.
<div class="split"></div>
Whenever possible, I like to develop software that's self contained and
dependency free. Software that you can uninstall by just
deleting the folder it is in.
<div class="split"></div>
The software I write is released for free and it's open-source. You are
welcome to download it, study it, modify if, break it and fix it. And,
if you want, to send a pull request to improve it for everybody.
<div class="split"></div>
My software runs, for the most part, on <i>*nix</i> systems. Other systems
may or may not be supported on a case by case basis.
<div class="split"></div>
 You are also welcome to visit my
<a href="https://github.com/lartu" class="external" target=_blank>GitHub</a> page.

<h1>projects</h1>

None. Right now I'm working on <a href="https://eterspire.com" class="external" target=_blank>Eterspire (Beta II)</a>.

<h1>legacy projects</h1>

I've worked on multiple other <a href="legacy_computing.html">programming projects</a>. 
Most of these aren't maintained anymore.
<div class="split"></div>
I've decided to reduce the number of projects I work on and maintain to leave more
time to work on more meaningful ones. Most of my legacy projects
reinvent the wheel in some way or another. I now try to work on software
that improves over existing alternatives in one way or another; or on
minimal, self-contained experiments.
