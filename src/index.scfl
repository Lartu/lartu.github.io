WRITE       A short, 64x64 resolution visual novel about friendship and rainy days, 
WRITE       made in 7 days for LOWREZJAM 2020. Full of typos, as the screenplay 
WRITE       was written during a long, coffee fueled night writing session.

HEADER      Programming Languages & Esolangs

SUBHEADER   WebSCFL üåé (2024)
LINKIMAGE   DISK5.png, https://github.com/Lartu/WebSCFL/, diskette
WRITE       WebSCFL stands for Web Sectioned Command First Language.
WRITE       It's a programming language designed to make simple
LINK        Prof. Dr. Style, http://contemporary-home-computing.org/prof-dr-style/
WRITE       websites.
WRITE       This website is written and compiled using WebSCFL.
WRITE       As you can see, it can be heavily tweaked to customize the resulting webpages.


SUBHEADER   Polaris Twist üçã (2024)
LINKIMAGE   DISK3.png, https://github.com/Lartu/Polaris-Twist/, diskette
WRITE       Polaris Twist üçã is a refreshing stack-based, concatenative, interpreted 
WRITE       programming language with strings as its only data type. It's a revision of my 
WRITE       original Polaris, much faster and with Foreign Function Interface support.
WRITE       It has been designed to be small in size and minimal in language features.
WRITE       Written in C++98, so it can probably be compiled with any C++ compiler out there.

SUBHEADER   Nari (2023)
LINKIMAGE   DISK4.png, https://github.com/Lartu/nari2023, diskette
WRITE       Nari (2023) is a new iteration of my Nari programming language.
WRITE       I develop it to relax, so I call Nari 'programming
WRITE       language programming as therapy'.
WRITE       Nari is inspired by Forth, or how I imagine Forth to be, as I've never 
WRITE       written a single line of Forth. Nari is a weakly typed language.
WRITE       Its only data types are strings and integers.
WRITE       I don't know if it's fast or not (it probably isn't). 
WRITE       I might expand it over time. I also might not.
FOOTNOTE    Nari was also the guinea pig in the picture above (2012-2020).

SUBHEADER   Polaris (2020)
LINKIMAGE   DISK2.png, https://github.com/Lartu/polaris, diskette
WRITE       A minimal, experimental stack-based, concatenative, interpreted 
WRITE       programming language with strings as its only data type. Written in C++98, 
WRITE       designed to run on Unix systems, backported to MS-DOS.

SUBHEADER   LDPL (2019)
LINKIMAGE   DISK1.png, https://www.ldpl-lang.org, diskette
WRITE       A COBOL-inspired programming language, designed to be expressive, 
WRITE       readable, fast and easy to learn. Considered complete and in minimal 
WRITE       evolution mode since LDPL 5.
